# Module Introduction and Learning Objectives

This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
* Understand loops by using visual examples and comparing them to tuples and lists.
* Understand functions by building a function using inputs and outputs.
* Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.

# Conditions and Branching

## Practice Quiz: Python Programming Fundamentals

Question 1: What is the result of the following: ```1=2```

- A. [ ] ```True```
- B. [X] ```SyntaxError:can't assign to literal```
- C. [ ] ```False```

Question 2: What is the output of the following code segment: 

```
i=6 

i<5
```

- A. [ ] ```SyntaxError: can't assign to literal```
- B. [X] ```False```
- C. [ ] ```True```

Question 3: What is the result of the following: ```5!=5```

- A. [ ] ```True```
- B. [X] ```False```

Question 4: What is the output of the following code segment:```'a'=='A'```
- A. [ ] ```True```
- B. [X] ```False```

Question 5: In the video, if ```age=18``` what would be the result.

- A. [ ] You can enter
- B. [X] Move on

Question 6: In the video what would be the result if we set the variable age as follows: ```age= -10```

- A. [ ]

```
you can enter 
move on
```

- B. [X]

```
go see Meat Loaf 
move on
```

Question 7: hat is the result of the following: ```True or False```

- A. [ ] ```False```
- B. [X] ```True```, an ```or``` statement is only False if all the Boolean values are False.
