# Module Introduction and Learning Objectives

This module delves into the unique ways to collect data by the use of APIs and webscraping. It further explores data collection by explaining how to read and collect data when dealing with different file formats.

## Learning Objectives

* Define the difference between APIs and REST APIs
* Learn how APIs receive and send information
* Demonstrate how to communicate with Watson text to speech and language translator through the use of APIs
* Learn the basics of webscraping
* Work with different file formats
