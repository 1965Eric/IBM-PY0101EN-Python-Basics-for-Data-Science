# Module Introduction and Learning Objectives

This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable.

Next, learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will:

* Understand tuples and lists by describing and manipulating tuple combinations and list data structures.
* Demonstrate understanding of dictionaries by writing structures with correct keys and values.
* Understand the differences between sets, tuples, and lists by creating sets.

# Lists and Tuples

[Lists](https://github.com/1965Eric/IBM-PY0101EN-Python-Basics-for-Data-Science/blob/main/PY0101EN-2-2-Lists.ipynb)

[Tuples](https://github.com/1965Eric/IBM-PY0101EN-Python-Basics-for-Data-Science/blob/main/PY0101EN-2-1-Tuples.ipynb)

## Practice Quiz: Lists and Tuples

Question 1: Consider the following tuple: ```say_what=('say',' what', 'you', 'will')```

What is the result of the following ```say_what[-1]``` ? 

- A. [X] ```'will'```
- B. [ ] ```'what'```
- C. [ ] ```'you'```
- D. [ ] ```'say'```

Question 2: Consider the following tuple ```A=(1,2,3,4,5)```, what is the result of the following: ```A[1:4]```:
- A. [ ] ```(2, 3, 4, 5)```
- B. [ ] ```(3, 4, 5)```
- C. [X] ```(2, 3, 4)```

Question 3: Consider the following tuple ```A=(1,2,3,4,5)```. What is the result of the following: ```len(A)```

- A. [ ] ```6```
- B. [X] ```5```
- C. [ ] ```4```

Question 4. Consider the following list ```B=[1,2,[3,'a'],[4,'b']]```. What is the result of the following: ```B[3][1]```

- A. [ ] ```c```
- B. [X] ```b```
- C. [ ] ```[4,"b"]```

Question 5: What is the result of the following operation? ```[1,2,3]+[1,1,1]```

- A. [ ] ```TypeError```
- B. [X] ```[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]```
- C. [ ] ```[2,3,4]```


Question 6: What is the length of the list ```A = [1]``` after the following operation: ```A.append([2,3,4,5])```

- A. [X] ```2```
- B. [ ] ```5```

Question 7: What is the result of the following: ```"Hello Mike".split()```
- A. [ ] ```["H"]```
- B. [ ] ```["HelloMike"]```
- C. [X] ```["Hello","Mike"]```

# Dictionaries

[Dictionaries](https://github.com/1965Eric/IBM-PY0101EN-Python-Basics-for-Data-Science/blob/main/PY0101EN-2-4-Dictionaries.ipynb)

## Practice Quiz: Dictionaries

Question 1: What are the keys of the following dictionary: ```{"a":1,"b":2}```

- A. [ ] ```1,2```
- B. [X] ```"a","b"```

Question 2: Consider the following Python Dictionary: ```Dict={"A":1,"B":"2","C":[3,3,3],"D":(4,4,4),'E':5,'F':6}``` What is the result of the following operation: ```Dict["D"]```

- A. [ ] ```[3,3,3]```
- B. [X] ```(4, 4, 4)```
- C. [ ] ```1```
