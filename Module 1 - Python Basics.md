# Module Introduction and Learning Objectives

This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings. Continue with the module and learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings.

## Learning objectives

In this lesson, you will learn the basics of Python and you will write your first Python program:

* Demonstrate an understanding of types in python by converting/casting data types: strings, floats, integers.
* Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
