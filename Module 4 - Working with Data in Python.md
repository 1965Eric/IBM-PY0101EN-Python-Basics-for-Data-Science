# Module Introduction and Learning Objectives

This module explains the basics of working with data in Python and begins the path with learning how to read and write files.

Continue the module and uncover the best Python libraries that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations.

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson you will learn about:

* Demonstrate an open function to create and identify a file object.
* Use pandas for library and data analysis by using commands.
* Demonstrate how to create a text file by using the open function.
* Demonstrate how to use NumPy to create multi-dimensional arrays.
